## Solutions to common DS/Algo questions

I went through multiple websites (InterviewBit, LeetCode, LeetFree, Geeks4Geeks) while trying out all the DS/Algo
questions. This repo contains the list of all the questions that I've solved along with a table summarizing that.

I did this simply to have one single place where I can see all the questions that I've solved across websites,
grouped by topics, difficulty, etc.

Go over to the [table.md](table.md) to see the complete list of all questions!
