## Topic:: Union Find
## Sub-topic:: 
## Difficulty:: Easy
## Approach:: Keep adding edges to the array. If at any point, you add and edge whose vertices already belong to the same component, it's a cycle. In other cases, take union.
## Time complexity:: O(N)
## Space complexity:: O(N)
## Notes:: The complexity can be improved by taking Union-by-rank and path compression... Not yet.
