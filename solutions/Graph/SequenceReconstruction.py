## Topic:: Graph, Backtracking
## Sub-topic:: Topological sort
## Difficulty:: Hard
## Approach:: Check if a topological sort exists, if it is unique, and if it is the same as the input
## Time complexity:: O(V + E)
## Space complexity:: O(V)
## Notes:: You could also backtrack and find all the topological sorts
## Bookmarked: Yes
