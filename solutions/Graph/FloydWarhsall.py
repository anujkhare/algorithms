## Topic:: Graph
## Sub-topic:: Shortest Path
## Difficulty:: Medium
## Approach:: Iterate over all k=1...|V|, update the paths between all pairs such that k is the maximum label on the vertex in the path.
## Time complexity:: O(|V| ^ 3)
## Space complexity:: O(E)
## Notes:: This is a very non-intuitive algorithm! Think of it as growing paths around lower indexed vertices.
