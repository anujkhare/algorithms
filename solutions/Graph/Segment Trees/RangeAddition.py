## Link:: https://leetfree.com/problems/range-addition.html
## Topic:: Graph
## Sub-topic:: Segment Tree
## Difficulty:: Medium
## Approach:: Create a segment tree with Lazy Propogation
## Time complexity:: O(k logN + N)
## Space complexity:: O(N)
## Notes:: Another very interesting approach is the "range caching" thing (by updating just the ends of the intervals)
