## Topic:: Heaps
## Sub-topic:: Min Heap
## Difficulty:: Medium
## Approach:: Insert the first element of all lists into a min heap along with some kind of a pointer. Pop, move the pointer, continue.
## Time complexity:: O(N logK) where N is the number of elements in the longest list.
## Space complexity:: O(K) extra space (besides output array)
## Notes:: Could also do with just K pointers, but the time complexity would be O(NK)
## Bookmarked:: No
