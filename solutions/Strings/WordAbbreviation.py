## Topic:: String, Trie, heuristics
## Sub-topic:: Trie, String, Greedy
## Difficulty:: Hard
## Approach:: Group based on first and last char, length. If more than one in a group, construct trie, find the shortest unique prefix
## Time complexity:: O(N.L) N: words, L: length
## Space complexity:: O(N.L)
## Notes:: Refer to the ShortestUniquePrefix problem
## Bookmarked: No
